[Integration into games]

To integrate the pixel images created in the Level Editor into your game, follow these steps:

1. Generate Pixel Images: Use the Level Editor to design and save your game levels as pixel images. These images are composed of two sections:
the left section contains information about solid tiles, objects, and enemies, while the right section holds decorations.

2. Solid Tiles, Objects, and Enemies:
   - In the left section of the pixel image, solid tiles, objects, and enemies are represented.
   - Solid tiles can be found on either layer 3 or layer 5.
   - If they are on layer 3, only the RED value serves as the ID of tile in the RGB format, while G and B are both set to 254.
   - If solid tiles are on layer 5, similarly, the RED value represents the ID of tile, but G and B are both set to 255.
   - For enemies, the GREEN value is utilized, with RED and BLUE set to 254.
   - Objects are identified using the BLUE value, with RED and GREEN set to 254.
   - In your game's code, extract the pixel values of the image's left section to recreate solid tiles, objects, and enemies in the respective layers and positions.

3. Decorations:
   - The right section of the pixel image contains decoration data.
   - Decorations are placed on layers 0, 1, 2, or 4.
   - The GREEN value determines the decoration layer, while the BLUE value signifies the decoration's ID.
   - Extract the pixel values from the image's right section in your game to accurately position and render the decorations.

4. Reading Pixel Data:
   - Utilize your game's image processing or pixel reading capabilities to interpret the RGB values of the pixel image.
   - Use the provided RGB mappings to extract information about tiles, objects, enemies, and decorations.
   - Implement the logic to place these elements in your game's level based on the pixel data.
